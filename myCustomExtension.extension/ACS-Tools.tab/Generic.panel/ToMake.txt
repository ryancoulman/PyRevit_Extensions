TO MAKE 
- Hide all sections not on sheet 
- Apply filter(s) to selected views on sheet 
    - (in sheet view) Form to select filter(s) and a button to turn visibility on or off 
    - If colour overides involved option to copy a filter from current view to others on sheet 
    - Use functiosn from Revit Links to get all views on sheet, and Overide All Filters for copying behavior 
- Custom script builder to allow user to create keyboard shortcuts to turn selected worksets on / off (nned individual script to assign KS too)
    - Some kind of pushsplitpulldown button that has a button to create a script which it adds to the pulldown 
    - The scripts can then simply just call some classes in a lib folder to handle hiding the worsket (just pass name / ID accross)
    - Could look at dev tab tool that allows you to create pushbuttons etc
    - Extend beyond worksets
